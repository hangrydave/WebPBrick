# README

This git repository provides the source codes for the **WebPBrick** project and hence the [webpbrick.com](http://webpbrick.com) website.


## WebPBrick How To

1. Build your NQC code (click the "Build" button)
2. Connect to the yellow programmable RCX brick using an infrared tower (click the "Serial Connect" button)
3. Download your compiled program to the RCX (click the "Download program to RCX" button)


## Toolchain modules

![Toolchain block diagram](./doc/toolchain.png)

WebPBrick's toolchain consists of several modules:

* WebNQC: The NQC compiler built as WebAssembly (WASM) for the web using emscripten.
* RCX image parser written in Kaitai Struct and compiled to JavaScript to parse and split RCX image binary files so that they can be downloaded to the RCX in their bytecode chunks.
* RCX communication libraries:
  * Based on Web Serial API to be used with the LEGO IR Serial Tower and [DIY IR serial towers](https://github.com/maehw/DiyIrTower)
  * Based on WebUSB API to be used with LEGO IR USB Tower


## Run

Start a local webserver, e.g. using Python:

```shell
python -m http.server 8080
```

Open your webbrowser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ide/
